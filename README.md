# capsule-compression-with-oomph-lib
Using oomph-lib to solve the continuum mechanics problem of compressing a thick shelled sphere

oomph-lib is an object-oriented, open-source finite-element library for the simulation of 
multi-physics problems (http://oomph-lib.maths.man.ac.uk/). 

This repository contains code that simulates the compression of a thick shelled spherical 
capsules of elastic material and filled with fluid between two parallel plates. 

Currently, this is in development and will not work with the public version of oomph-lib.
